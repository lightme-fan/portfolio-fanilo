I am Fanilo and love creating useful stuff. I am a front-end developer from Onja Madagascar. I am self-motivated and keen to learn new skills which include computer programming. Onja is an organization that is a team of motivated and intelligent young people in Madagascar who are keen to work with others from anywhere in the world.
